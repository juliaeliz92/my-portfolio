export const about_me = [
    `I was hooked on programming when I did my first C program at my school computer lab in 2008. Fast 
    forward to today, I have the pleasure of extending my services to companies ranging from start ups 
    to MNCs that deliver SaaS products for industries such as tourism, security, financial and marketing.`,
    `Apart from designing and front facing softwares for businesses, I volunteer at non profit 
    communities such as 'Women Who Code', that supports women to get a head start at tech industry by 
    providing technical mentoring. I also take my time learning new trending technologies that help me 
    upscale backend skills and develop personal projects on them.`,
    `In my free time, I enjoy catching up with my books, writing journals or short stories, de-stress
    with my acrylic painting, taking long walks or driving around the country. `
